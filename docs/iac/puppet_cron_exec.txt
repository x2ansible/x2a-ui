The Puppet `cron` resource manages scheduled tasks. Useful attributes include:
- `command`: The script or binary to run
- `user`: User to run the job as
- `hour`, `minute`, `weekday`, etc.

Example:
cron { 'nightly_backup':
  ensure  => present,
  command => '/usr/local/bin/backup.sh',
  user    => 'root',
  hour    => 2,
  minute  => 30,
}
